        Pain itself is important, it is love, the main driving force, but I give
        in to the pain, so that the pain may come to an end, for it is the
        pleasure of the whole soul. Indeed, in order to attain the least
        advantage, he should exercise his labor, unless he gains some advantage
        from it.
